# Deep neural architectures for dialect classification with single frequency filtering and zero−time windowing feature representations

### Corpus: UT-Podcast
UT-Podcast is a speech corpus collected from podcasts, it has three dialects of English (US, UK, AU). Please download it from [here](https://crss.utdallas.edu/corpora/UT-Podcast/). For more details [refer](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1016/j.specom.2015.12.004)
