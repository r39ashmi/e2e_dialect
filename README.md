# Deep neural architectures for dialect classification with single frequency filtering and zero−time windowing feature representations

### Corpus: UT-Podcast
UT-Podcast is a speech corpus collected from podcasts, it has three dialects of English (US, UK, AU). Please download it from [here](https://crss.utdallas.edu/corpora/UT-Podcast/). For more details [refer](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1016/j.specom.2015.12.004)


### Feature Extraction
For extraction of features (STFT, SFF, and ZTW based features), MATLAB is used. Code for feature extraction will soon be updated at feature_extraction/

### Neural Network Architectures for Dialect Classification
This project implements three neural architectures:
1. The code for **Convolution Neural Network** architecture can be found in 
2. The code for **Convolution Neural Network with embedded spectra filter as convolution layer** architecture can be found in 
3. The code for **Temporal Convolution Neural Network** architecture can be found in
4. The code for **Time delay Neural Network** architecture can be found in

**NOTE**: Please find the pre-trained models at:
